## Bank Customer Segmentation and Personalization

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs customer segmentation and personalization for a banking dataset. The analysis aims to identify distinct customer segments based on their behaviours and characteristics, allowing for tailored marketing strategies and product recommendations.

### Project Overview

The project is structured into several key sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the importance of customer segmentation in the banking industry.

2. **Data Loading and Preparation**: This process loads the dataset and performs initial data cleaning, including handling missing values and transforming variables as needed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: This process involves conducting a thorough analysis of the dataset to understand customer demographics, behaviours, and spending patterns. Visualizations illustrate key insights.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Involves creating new features that can enhance the model's predictive power, such as aggregating transaction data or encoding categorical variables.

5. **Clustering Analysis**: This method utilizes clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) to segment customers into distinct groups based on their characteristics. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the clustering results using silhouette scores and visualizations to ensure the segments are meaningful.

7. **Personalization Strategy**: Develop a strategy for personalized marketing based on the identified customer segments, suggesting specific products or services for each group.

8. **Conclusion**: This section summarizes the findings and provides recommendations for future work or potential applications of the analysis.

### Tools and Libraries Used

The analysis leverages several powerful Python libraries:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and support for multi-dimensional arrays.
- **Matplotlib**: This is for data visualization and creating static plots.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced statistical visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implementing machine learning algorithms, particularly for clustering.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** reduces data dimensions before analysis.

- **KMeans** is essential for clustering, a key unsupervised learning technique.

- **Datapurifier** library helps conduct exploratory data analysis, which is vital in the initial stages of any data science project.

- **SweetViz** is valuable for producing comprehensive data visualizations that provide deep insights into data patterns.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes customer information such as:

- Demographic details (age, gender, income)
- Account information (account balance, transaction history)
- Behavioral data (spending habits, product usage)

The dataset is in CSV format and should be placed in the same directory as the notebook for seamless loading.

### Installation and Usage

To run the notebook, please make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn sweetviz data-purifier
```

After installing the dependencies, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.
